##  Conclusion

The sales analysis reveals clear and impactful insights that challenge common assumptions and open opportunities for strategic growth:
- * Contrary to expectations, larger outlets are not the top performers, and Low Fat items show a clear customer preference.
- * Low Fat items dominate, contributing over 64% of total sales, confirming a strong consumer preference for healthier options.
- * Fruits & Vegetables lead item type sales, followed closely by Snack Foods. This is a sign to prioritize inventory and marketing for these categories.
- * Tier 3 outlets and medium-sized stores outperform all others in total sales, proving that size and tier do not guarantee success.
